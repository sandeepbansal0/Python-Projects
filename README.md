# 📊 Predicting Behavior Change — Uplift Modeling for Digital Engagement

## Executive Summary

Traditional engagement models predict who is likely to click or complete an article.  
This project goes further — it estimates who can be influenced.

Using behavioral session data across multiple news domains, I built a causal uplift modeling framework to measure the incremental impact of short-form video exposure on article completion.

**Objective**

> Identify users who become more likely to engage when exposed to video — not just those already likely to engage.
